MLOps is "a thing" SREs shall not miss to get their hands on.
A SRE meets a MLOps analyst on a journey to find out how they can help each other.
Join us on this exploratory talk about the importance of MLOps in modern organisations and how engineers 

Questions:
1. Should SREs get on the MLOps hype?
2. Can SREs benefit from doing MLOps?
3. Can MLOps benefit from SREs involvement?


Monitoring
Monitoring classical applications is relativaly simple. We've been doing it for decades. monitoring in MLOps is a bit harder. 
We usually look for an answer to a following questions:
- is an application up 
- is an application performing well
When we monitor models, the question becomes not "is the model correct" but more like "is the model better or worse" - which is an entirely different task 
to answer
